<h1>Hi everyone! My name is Savannah Wihongi, thanks for visiting my site!</h1>

<p>
   I am absolutely passionate about traveling and living a healthy, active lifestyle. I grew up most of my life in a little suburb 30 minutes outside of Salt Lake City, Utah. 
   I come from a family of 7 boys and 3 girls. Yup you heard me right, 10 kids all together! There was never a dull moment in our household to say the least.
</p>
<p>
   When I turned 16 I moved over to Hawaii and finished up my last year of school at Kahuku High school. Moving to Hawaii was better than I ever imagined. As cliché as it sounds, 
   it’s honestly been a dream come true living here. I’ve always been one for going on spontaneous adventures. For me traveling opens my heart and eyes to learn more about the world 
   than any history class could ever offer. I am incredibly grateful for the places I’ve been able to visit for it has played a huge role in the person I am today. 
   Besides traveling I love anything health and fitness related! I’m at my best when I’m taking care of my body and living an active lifestyle. I also love being outside soaking up all that mother nature has to offer.
</p>
<p>
   Currently I am living in Hawaii working to save up and squeezing in as much adventures as I possible can. This next year is going to be filled with so many exciting things and 
   I want to share it all with you! I hope that somehow I may contribute to empowering and inspiring all of you to be true to yourself, follow your passions and achieve your goals.
 </p>
